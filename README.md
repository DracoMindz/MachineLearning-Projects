# Machine Learning Projects
Project from Machine Learning Specialization


These projects I have spent time creating during my Machine Learning Specialization at Holberton School.
While working on these projects I have learned a great deal about the various aspect of machine learning.
At first I confused Machine Learning with Data Science.  I am sure It ids a mistake made by many who are
new to either Data Science or Machine Learning.

According to a blog from ML Corner titled "Should I learn Machine learning or data science first?" the author
states "Machine Learning ia a key part of Data Science." The authore goes on to recommend taking Data Analysis
before learning Machine Learning and then learning Data Science.

Machine learning is a way of expressing how and what to learn from the data. In general Machine Learning is

all about computers learning from data and based on what is has learned making predictions. Predictions can
come in the form of predicting how a stock will perform in the furture based on how it performed in the past.
Recommendation as to what movies you will like on  Netflix are based on predictions made as a result of the
utilization of Machine Learning.

Machine learning also has to do with facial recognition, voice recognition and computers learning to play
better chess than humans.
